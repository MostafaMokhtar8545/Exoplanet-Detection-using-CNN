# Exoplanet-Detection-using-CNN
The project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyse the flux data and accurately classify stars as either exoplanet-hosting or non-exoplanet-hosting. By training a model on the provided dataset, we seek to uncover patterns and features indicative of exoplanet presence, enabling the model to make predictions on unseen data.
